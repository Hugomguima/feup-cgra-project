### Description

The aim of this project was built a WebGL scene using transformations, illumination, materials, textures and shaders that we learned in practical classes. The source code that I did in practical classes can be found in [this repository]().

All skybox textures are from [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/art-search?keys=skybox).
