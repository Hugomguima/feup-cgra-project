### Description

The aim of this project was built a WebGL scene using transformations, illumination, materials, textures and shaders that we learned in practical classes. The source code that I did in practical classes can be found in [this repository]().

Some skybox textures used in this project can be found on [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/art-search?keys=skybox).

### Setup

To run this project you need to start a local server on its root. If you have trouble configuring your local server you can also see this project on [Github Pages]().

### Tools Used

- Javascript
- WebGL
- WebCFG

### Textures

The textures of the terrain and skybox, as well as their visibility on the scene, can be changed in the interface, more specifically in the folder that says Scenario Config. Vehicle textures and visibility can be changed in the Vehicle Config folder. I

##### CubeMap

We have a lot of SkyBoxes textures that we found online. Two of them are inspired in My Little Pony.

##### Zeppelin Texture

We made two different textures for our Zeppelin. One of them is inspired in Rainbow Dash, one pegasus from *My Little Pony*, and the other texture is inspired in the Portal game ~~one box is our beloved companion cube~~.

### Other Remarks

In addition, it is also possible to view both the cylinder and the sphere individually, as well as the normal ones of all objects present on the scene.
Also if the current SkyBox texture is Palace or Rainbow Dash, you can listen My Little Pony theme song in Portuguese selecting Music in Scenario Config.
Our boxes also have horizontal movement, following the rotation and direction of our zeppelin.
